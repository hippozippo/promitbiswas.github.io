                    <b><center>NIT Durgapur Model United Nations Conference beckons the delegates to be a part of the deliberation.<br/></center></b>
					The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization established on 24 October 1945 to promote international co-operation. 
Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an extra-curricular activity in which students typically roleplay delegates to the United Nations and simulate UN committees. 
This activity takes place at MUN conferences, which is usually organized by a high school or college MUN club. The discussions range from important global issues from drug trades and human trafficking to socioeconomic issues to trade relationships between nations. At the end the council strives to get to consensus. In a MUN one improves his/her substantial researching, public speaking, debating, and writing skills, as well as critical thinking, teamwork, leadership abilities and knowledge about relations between the countries of the world . 
Today the MUN is rapidly re-inventing itself; many MUN conferences hold simulations that are not UN committees. MUN not only contain various councils, it also has an international press (IP) in which the students have to role-play as reporters and photographers  of relevant media organizations such as Al Jazeera, BBC and Reuters. 
The aims of an MUN conference are to encourage debate and sharing of views between students from different schools and of different ethnicities. The Ultimate goal of an MUN Conference is to promote awareness of international relations and issues in young people, and to inspire global mindedness and an understanding to the problems of the world and how to combat them, whilst providing an atmosphere where students can progress in their communication skills and open mindedness. This would allow students an insight to further their understanding and learning of politics in a global and international manner.

                    <span class="em">ECOSOC</span>
                        <p> The agenda for Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is: “Economic and Technical Cooperation Among Developing Countries.” The topic takes into account the different levels of economic and technical development among the developing countries and is meant to take up for discussion, issues relating to the desirous of achieving a more dynamic, commercial and economic relationship among the countries. In the past three decades, with the emergence of a large number of newly independent developing countries with undeveloped economies, the global concern for developmental problems has resulted in the corresponding expansion of international economic and social cooperation. The council’s focus will be to encourage investments by the nationals in each other’s territories, inter-alia, the consideration of investment-promotion activities and the exchange of information on investment opportunities. It will further go on to discuss the promotion of cooperation in the areas such as human resource development, institution building, science and technology, research and development etc. It will also be focussing on priority issues such as, trade and investment, debt, production and employment, macro-economic policy coordination etc which are likely to have a major role in the development of the developing countries. In conjunction with this, the council will also track down the history of the various bilateral and multilateral agreements and pacts among various countries and will go on to analyse their present operational scenario, finally continuing on with their scope in the future.
